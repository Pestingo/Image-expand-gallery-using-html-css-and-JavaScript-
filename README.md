## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://image-expand-gallery-using-html-css-and-java-script.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Responsive image layout.
- Interactive image expansion effect with smooth transitions.
- Thematic image captions for an enhanced visual experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

```bash
Image-expand-gallery/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── style.css       # Styles for the gallery
└── script.js       # JavaScript logic for image interaction
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pestingo/Image-expand-gallery-using-html-css-and-JavaScript-.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-expand-gallery-using-html-css-and-JavaScript-
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the gallery.

## How It Works

- The gallery consists of multiple images, and only one image is expanded and highlighted at a time.
- When you click on an image, it becomes the active image while the others shrink in size.
- CSS handles the transitions, while JavaScript manages which image is active.

## Customization

- Replace the images in the `index.html` file with your own by updating the `src` attributes.
- Modify the styles in `style.css` to customize the appearance of the gallery.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-expand-gallery.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd image-expand-gallery
Open index.html in your preferred browser.
How It Works
The gallery contains multiple images, and only one image is expanded and highlighted at a time.
When you click an image, it becomes the active image while the others shrink in size.
The CSS handles the transitions, while JavaScript controls which image is active.
Customization
Replace the images in the HTML code with your own by updating the src attribute.
You can also modify the styles in style.css to change the appearance of the gallery.
